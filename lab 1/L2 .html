    <h1> what is css</h1>
    <p>
        CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It's a language used to **style and layout web pages**—basically, it controls how HTML elements look in the browser.

With CSS, you can:

- Set **colors**, **fonts**, and **sizes**
- Adjust **spacing** (margins, padding)
- Create **layouts** (grids, flexbox, positioning)
- Add **animations and transitions**
- Make websites **responsive** (look good on phones, tablets, etc.)

Here's a super simple example:

```html

This would make all &lth&gt elements blue, big, and centered.

Want me to break down how CSS works with HTML or show more examples?
